Background tasks require the `fastmcp-tasks` package. See [enabling background tasks](#enabling-background-tasks) below.
FastMCP implements the MCP background tasks extension ([`io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks`](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/tasks/overview), SEP-2663), giving your servers a production-ready distributed task scheduler with one extension registration and a decorator change.

**What is Docket?** FastMCP’s task system is powered by [Docket](https://github.com/chrisguidry/docket), originally built by [Prefect](https://prefect.io) to power [Prefect Cloud](https://www.prefect.io/prefect/cloud)’s managed task scheduling and execution service, where it processes millions of concurrent tasks every day. Docket is now open-sourced for the community.

](#what-are-mcp-background-tasks)What Are MCP Background Tasks?

In MCP, a tool call is blocking by default. When a client calls a tool, it sends a request and waits for the response. For operations that take seconds or minutes, this creates a poor user experience.
Background tasks solve this by letting a server tell a supporting client:

- **Start** the tool and return a task ID immediately

- **Poll** for status as the tool runs

- **Retrieve** the result when ready — or answer a question the tool asks mid-run

FastMCP handles all of this for you. Add `task=True` to a tool decorator and register the tasks extension, and your function gains background execution with progress reporting, distributed processing, and horizontal scaling.

### [​

](#mcp-background-tasks-vs-python-concurrency)MCP Background Tasks vs Python Concurrency

You can always use Python’s concurrency primitives (asyncio, threads, multiprocessing) or external task queues in your FastMCP servers. FastMCP is just Python—run code however you like.
MCP background tasks are different: they’re **protocol-native**. This means MCP clients that support the tasks extension can start a call, poll it, and retrieve its result through the standard MCP interface. The coordination happens at the protocol level, not inside your application code.

## [​

](#enabling-background-tasks)Enabling Background Tasks

Background tasks require the `fastmcp-tasks` package:

```
pip install "fastmcp[tasks]"

```

Register `TasksExtension` on your server, then add `task=True` to a tool decorator. `task=True` marks the tool as *capable* of background execution; the extension is what actually runs it — a `task=True` tool on a server with no tasks extension registered raises at server startup.

```
import asyncio
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp_tasks import TasksExtension

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
mcp.add_extension(TasksExtension())

@mcp.tool(task=True)
async def slow_computation(duration: int) -> str:
    """A long-running operation."""
    for i in range(duration):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Completed in {duration} seconds"

```

Whether a given call actually runs as a task depends on the client: it opts in per request, and the *server* decides based on the tool’s execution mode (below). When it does run as a task, the call returns immediately with a task ID; the work executes in a background worker, and the client polls for the result. A [FastMCP client](/clients/tasks) does all of this transparently — `client.call_tool(...)` looks the same either way.
Background tasks are a modern-protocol feature: the tasks capability is negotiated over `2026-07-28` connections, so a client pinned to `mode="legacy"` never triggers one — the tool always runs synchronously for it.

Background tasks require async functions. Attempting to use `task=True` with a sync function raises a `ValueError` at registration time. Only tools can be task-enabled; resources, resource templates, and prompts do not carry `task=`.

## [​

](#execution-modes)Execution Modes

For fine-grained control over task execution behavior, use `TaskConfig` instead of the boolean shorthand. The tasks extension defines three execution modes:
 |
|  | Mode | Client calls without the tasks capability | Client calls with the tasks capability
|  | `"forbidden"` | Executes synchronously | Executes synchronously (never tasked)
|  | `"optional"` | Executes synchronously | Executes as a background task
|  | `"required"` | Error: task required | Executes as a background task

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.utilities.tasks import TaskConfig
from fastmcp_tasks import TasksExtension

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
mcp.add_extension(TasksExtension())

# Supports both sync and background execution (default when task=True)
@mcp.tool(task=TaskConfig(mode="optional"))
async def flexible_task() -> str:
    return "Works either way"

# Requires background execution - errors if the client didn't opt in
@mcp.tool(task=TaskConfig(mode="required"))
async def must_be_background() -> str:
    return "Only runs as a background task"

# No task support (default when task=False or omitted)
@mcp.tool(task=TaskConfig(mode="forbidden"))
async def sync_only() -> str:
    return "Never runs as background task"

```

The boolean shortcuts map to these modes:

- `task=True` → `TaskConfig(mode="optional")`

- `task=False` → `TaskConfig(mode="forbidden")`

When a `mode="required"` tool is called by a client that didn’t opt in, FastMCP returns a “missing required capability” error rather than running it synchronously.

### [​

](#poll-interval)Poll Interval

When a client polls for task status, the server can suggest how frequently to check back:

```
from datetime import timedelta
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.utilities.tasks import TaskConfig
from fastmcp_tasks import TasksExtension

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
mcp.add_extension(TasksExtension())

# Poll every 2 seconds for a fast-completing task
@mcp.tool(task=TaskConfig(mode="optional", poll_interval=timedelta(seconds=2)))
async def quick_task() -> str:
    return "Done quickly"

# Poll every 30 seconds for a long-running task
@mcp.tool(task=TaskConfig(mode="optional", poll_interval=timedelta(seconds=30)))
async def slow_task() -> str:
    return "Eventually done"

```

Shorter intervals give clients faster feedback but increase server load. The interval is a ceiling, not an exact cadence — the FastMCP client starts polling quickly and backs off toward it, so a fast task is still observed as done almost immediately.

### [​

](#server-wide-default)Server-Wide Default

To enable background task support for all tools by default, pass `tasks=True` to the constructor. Individual decorators can still override this with `task=False`.

```
mcp = FastMCP("MyServer", tasks=True)

```

If your server defines any synchronous tools, you will need to explicitly set `task=False` on their decorators to avoid an error.

### [​

](#configuration)Configuration

`TasksExtension` takes the backend configuration directly, with `FASTMCP_DOCKET_*` environment variables as defaults — so `TasksExtension()` works out of the box against an env-configured deployment:

```
mcp.add_extension(TasksExtension(url="redis://localhost:6379/0", concurrency=20))

```

 |
|  | Environment Variable | Default | Description
|  | `FASTMCP_DOCKET_URL` | `memory://` | Backend URL (`memory://` or `redis://host:port/db`)
|  | `FASTMCP_DOCKET_NAME` | `fastmcp` | Queue name. Servers and workers sharing a name and URL share a queue.
|  | `FASTMCP_DOCKET_CONCURRENCY` | `10` | Maximum concurrent tasks per worker.

## [​

](#backends)Backends

FastMCP supports two backends for task execution, each with different tradeoffs.

### [​

](#in-memory-backend-default)In-Memory Backend (Default)

The in-memory backend (`memory://`) requires zero configuration and works out of the box.
**Advantages:**

- No external dependencies

- Simple single-process deployment

**Disadvantages:**

- **Ephemeral**: If the server restarts, all pending tasks are lost

- **Higher latency**: ~250ms task pickup time vs single-digit milliseconds with Redis

- **No horizontal scaling**: Single process only—you cannot add additional workers

### [​

](#redis-backend)Redis Backend

For production deployments, use Redis (or Valkey) as your backend:

```
mcp.add_extension(TasksExtension(url="redis://localhost:6379/0"))

```

**Advantages:**

- **Persistent**: Tasks survive server restarts

- **Fast**: Single-digit millisecond task pickup latency

- **Scalable**: Add workers to distribute load across processes or machines

## [​

](#workers)Workers

Every FastMCP server with task-enabled tools automatically starts an **embedded worker**. You do not need to start a separate worker process for tasks to execute.
To scale horizontally, add more workers:

```
python -m fastmcp_tasks.worker_cli worker server.py

```

Each additional worker pulls tasks from the same queue, distributing load across processes. Configure worker concurrency via environment:

```
export FASTMCP_DOCKET_CONCURRENCY=20
python -m fastmcp_tasks.worker_cli worker server.py

```

Additional workers only work with Redis/Valkey backends. The in-memory backend is single-process only.

Task-enabled tools must be defined at server startup to be registered with all workers. Tools added dynamically after the server starts will not be available for background execution.

## [​

](#gathering-input-mid-task)Gathering Input Mid-Task

A tool can ask the client a question partway through — the same [guard pattern](/servers/elicitation#elicitation-on-the-modern-protocol) used for multi-round-trip input on foreground calls: instead of awaiting a response, the tool *returns* one, and FastMCP re-runs it once the client answers.

```
from fastmcp import Context, FastMCP
from fastmcp_tasks import TasksExtension
from mcp.types import (
    ElicitRequest,
    ElicitRequestFormParams,
    ElicitResult,
    InputRequiredResult,
)

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
mcp.add_extension(TasksExtension())

@mcp.tool(task=True)
async def plan_dinner(ctx: Context) -> str | InputRequiredResult:
    responses = ctx.input_responses
    if responses is None:
        # First leg: ask a question and end here.
        request = ElicitRequest(
            params=ElicitRequestFormParams(
                message="What are you in the mood for?",
                requested_schema={"type": "object", "properties": {"cuisine": {"type": "string"}}},
            )
        )
        return InputRequiredResult(
            result_type="input_required",
            input_requests={"prefs": request},
        )

    # Re-entered leg: the client's answer is on ctx.input_responses.
    answer = responses["prefs"]
    assert isinstance(answer, ElicitResult)
    return f"Tonight: {answer.content['cuisine']}!"

```

Run as a task, this “ends” the tool’s first leg entirely rather than blocking a worker on the client’s answer: the task reports `input_required`, the client answers, and FastMCP re-invokes the tool with the answer attached. No worker ever sits idle waiting on a round-trip — the same tool works identically whether it’s called synchronously or as a background task, and a [FastMCP client](/clients/tasks) answers the question automatically through its elicitation handler.

Imperative `await ctx.elicit(...)` is not supported inside a background task — it would require blocking a worker for the length of a client round-trip. Use the guard pattern (return `InputRequiredResult`) instead; calling `ctx.elicit()` from a task-enabled tool raises with guidance toward the guard pattern.

## [​

](#progress-reporting)Progress Reporting

The `Progress` dependency lets you report progress back to clients. Inject it as a parameter with a default value, and FastMCP will provide the active progress reporter.

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.dependencies import Progress

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

@mcp.tool(task=True)
async def process_files(files: list[str], progress: Progress = Progress()) -> str:
    await progress.set_total(len(files))

    for file in files:
        await progress.set_message(f"Processing {file}")
        # ... do work ...
        await progress.increment()

    return f"Processed {len(files)} files"

```

The progress API:

- `await progress.set_total(n)` — Set the total number of steps

- `await progress.increment(amount=1)` — Increment progress

- `await progress.set_message(text)` — Update the status message

Progress works in both immediate and background execution modes—you can use the same code regardless of how the client invokes your function.

## [​

](#docket-dependencies)Docket Dependencies

FastMCP exposes Docket’s full dependency injection system within your task-enabled functions. Beyond `Progress`, you can access the Docket instance, worker information, and use advanced features like retries and timeouts.

```
from docket import Docket, Worker
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.dependencies import Progress
from fastmcp_tasks.dependencies import CurrentDocket, CurrentWorker

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

@mcp.tool(task=True)
async def my_task(
    progress: Progress = Progress(),
    docket: Docket = CurrentDocket(),
    worker: Worker = CurrentWorker(),
) -> str:
    # Schedule additional background work
    await docket.add(another_task, arg1, arg2)

    # Access worker metadata
    worker_name = worker.name

    return "Done"

```

With `CurrentDocket()`, you can schedule additional background tasks, chain work together, and coordinate complex workflows. See the [Docket documentation](https://docket.lol/) for the complete API, including retry policies, timeouts, and custom dependencies.[Server Extensions

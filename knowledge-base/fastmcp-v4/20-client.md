# The FastMCP Client

Copy pageCopy page

Programmatic client for interacting with MCP servers through a well-typed, Pythonic interface.

Copy pageCopy page

The `fastmcp.Client` class provides a programmatic interface for interacting with any MCP server. It handles protocol details and connection management automatically, letting you focus on the operations you want to perform.
The FastMCP Client is designed for deterministic, controlled interactions rather than autonomous behavior, making it ideal for testing MCP servers during development, building deterministic applications that need reliable MCP interactions, and creating the foundation for agentic or LLM-based clients with structured, type-safe operations.

This is a programmatic client that requires explicit function calls and provides direct control over all MCP operations. Use it as a building block for higher-level systems.

](#creating-a-client)Creating a Client

You provide a server source and the client automatically infers the appropriate transport mechanism.

```
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

# In-memory server (ideal for testing)
server = FastMCP("TestServer")
client = Client(server)

# HTTP server
client = Client("https://example.com/mcp")

# Local Python script
client = Client("my_mcp_server.py")

async def main():
    async with client:
        # List available operations
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        resources = await client.list_resources()
        prompts = await client.list_prompts()

        # Execute operations
        result = await client.call_tool("example_tool", {"param": "value"})
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())

```

All client operations require using the `async with` context manager for proper connection lifecycle management.

## [​

](#choosing-a-transport)Choosing a Transport

The client automatically selects a transport based on what you pass to it, but different transports have different characteristics that matter for your use case.
**In-memory transport** connects directly to a FastMCP server instance within the same Python process. Use this for testing and development where you want to eliminate subprocess and network complexity. The server shares your process’s environment and memory space.

```
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

server = FastMCP("TestServer")
client = Client(server)  # In-memory, no network or subprocess

```

**STDIO transport** launches a server as a subprocess and communicates through stdin/stdout pipes. This is the standard mechanism used by desktop clients like Claude Desktop. By default, the subprocess receives the MCP SDK’s default environment; pass an explicit transport when you need to add environment variables, set a working directory, or control process reuse.

```
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import PythonStdioTransport

# Simple inference from file path
client = Client("my_server.py")

# With explicit environment configuration
transport = PythonStdioTransport(
    "my_server.py",
    env={"API_KEY": "secret"},
)
client = Client(transport)

```

**HTTP transport** connects to servers running as web services. Use this for production deployments where the server runs independently and manages its own lifecycle.

```
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client("https://api.example.com/mcp")

```

See [Transports](/clients/transports) for detailed configuration options including authentication headers, session persistence, and multi-server configurations.

## [​

](#configuration-based-clients)Configuration-Based Clients

Create clients from MCP configuration dictionaries, which can include multiple servers. While there is no official standard for MCP configuration format, FastMCP follows established conventions used by tools like Claude Desktop.

```
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
            "url": "https://weather-api.example.com/mcp"
        },
        "assistant": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["./assistant_server.py"]
        }
    }
}

client = Client(config)

async with client:
    # Tools are prefixed with server names
    weather_data = await client.call_tool("weather_get_forecast", {"city": "London"})
    response = await client.call_tool("assistant_answer_question", {"question": "What's the capital of France?"})

    # Resources use prefixed URIs
    icons = await client.read_resource("weather://weather/icons/sunny")

```

## [​

](#connection-lifecycle)Connection Lifecycle

The client uses context managers for connection management. When you enter the context, the client establishes a connection and negotiates the protocol era with the server. Metadata returned by either legacy initialization or modern discovery is exposed through the same client properties.

```
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer", instructions="Use the greet tool to say hello!")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet a user by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

async with Client(mcp) as client:
    # Protocol negotiation already happened automatically
    assert client.server_info is not None
    assert client.server_capabilities is not None
    print(f"Server: {client.server_info.name}")
    print(f"Instructions: {client.instructions}")
    print(f"Capabilities: {client.server_capabilities.tools}")

```

For advanced scenarios where you need precise control over when initialization happens, disable automatic initialization and call `initialize()` manually:

```
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client("my_mcp_server.py", auto_initialize=False)

async with client:
    # Connection established, but not initialized yet
    print(f"Connected: {client.is_connected()}")
    print(f"Initialized: {client.initialize_result is not None}")  # False

    # Initialize manually with custom timeout
    result = await client.initialize(timeout=10.0)
    print(f"Server: {result.server_info.name}")

    # Now ready for operations
    tools = await client.list_tools()

```

## [​

](#protocol-negotiation)Protocol negotiation

MCP has two protocol eras: the original *legacy* era, which begins every connection with an `initialize` handshake, and the *modern* era (protocol version `2026-07-28` and later), which a client discovers by probing the server’s `server/discover` endpoint. The `mode` parameter controls which era the client negotiates when it connects.
By default, `mode="auto"`. The client probes `server/discover` and adopts the modern protocol when the server responds; for any server that is not positive evidence of modern support, it falls back to the legacy handshake. This makes the default safe against a mixed fleet of legacy and modern servers.

```
from fastmcp import Client

# Negotiate the newest era the server supports (the default)
client = Client("https://example.com/mcp", mode="auto")

```

Set `mode="legacy"` to force the initialize handshake. This behaves identically to earlier FastMCP versions and is the opt-out if a server misbehaves under discovery or you need the legacy `initialize` result object.

```
client = Client("https://example.com/mcp", mode="legacy")

```

Legacy mode is also what carries the *pushed* form of a server’s requests. The handshake opens a persistent back-channel down which a server can send a sampling, roots, or elicitation request mid-call, and the modern era removed it. Your handlers are unaffected by that: a [sampling](/clients/sampling), [roots](/clients/roots), or [elicitation](/clients/elicitation) handler you register answers a modern server’s [input-required rounds](/clients/elicitation#input-required-rounds) from the same registration. Pin `mode="legacy"` when you connect to a server that pushes, or when your code calls `client.ping()` or `transport.get_session_id()`, which need the session the modern era does not open.
Conversely, [background tasks](/clients/tasks) are **modern-only**: the tasks capability is negotiated over `2026-07-28` connections, so `mode="legacy"` never triggers one and a task-enabled tool just runs synchronously.
A FastMCP server serves both eras, so a default client negotiates the modern one and the session-dependent calls raise an era-specific error there. Pinning the handshake restores them.
You can also pin a specific modern protocol version to adopt it directly, without a discovery probe:

```
client = Client("https://example.com/mcp", mode="2026-07-28")

```

Once connected, the negotiated version, server identity, capabilities, and instructions are available as properties. They are populated from either the legacy `InitializeResult` or modern `DiscoverResult`, and reset to `None` when the client disconnects. `instructions` is also `None` when the server does not provide any.
When you pin a modern version directly, the client skips discovery and adopts that version with minimal synthesized metadata. In that mode, `server_info` has an empty name and `instructions` is `None`.

```
async with Client("https://example.com/mcp", mode="auto") as client:
    print(client.protocol_version)      # e.g. "2026-07-28"
    print(client.server_info)           # Implementation | None
    print(client.server_capabilities)   # ServerCapabilities | None
    print(client.instructions)          # str | None

```

`mode="auto"` is the default as of FastMCP 4.0. Earlier versions defaulted to `"legacy"`. If a server behaves unexpectedly under discovery, or you depend on the legacy `initialize` result, pin the old behavior with `Client(..., mode="legacy")`.The SSE transport is legacy-only — it cannot carry the sessionless modern era — so a client connecting over SSE always negotiates the legacy handshake, even under `mode="auto"`. A multi-server config (`MCPConfigTransport` with more than one server) is likewise legacy-only, because it mounts each backend behind a legacy-era proxy; a single-server config mirrors its one backend transport’s era.

## [​

](#response-caching)Response caching

The client can cache the results of `list_tools`, `list_resources`, `list_prompts`, and `read_resource` so that repeated calls avoid a network round-trip. Caching is opt-in and honors the server’s own cache hints, so it only takes effect against modern-era servers that advertise them — a cache is inert on a legacy connection.
Enable the default in-memory cache by passing `cache=True`. It respects the `ttlMs` and `cacheScope` hints the server attaches to each response.

```
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client("https://example.com/mcp", mode="auto", cache=True)

async with client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()   # fetched from the server
    tools = await client.list_tools()   # served from the cache

```

The default (`cache=None`) and `cache=False` both disable caching. For control over the store, TTL, or partitioning, pass a `CacheConfig`. A custom config requires a `target_id`, since in-memory FastMCP transports expose no server URL to derive a shared-store identity from.

```
from fastmcp import Client
from mcp.client.caching import CacheConfig

config = CacheConfig(target_id="weather-api", default_ttl_ms=60_000)
client = Client("https://example.com/mcp", mode="auto", cache=config)

```

The high-level `list_tools`, `list_resources`, `list_prompts`, and `read_resource` methods always use the cache when one is configured. To override the behavior for a single call, use the lower-level `*_mcp` variants, which accept a `cache_mode` argument: `"use"` (the default) serves and stores, `"refresh"` stores a fresh result without serving a cached one, and `"bypass"` skips the cache entirely.

```
async with client:
    fresh = await client.list_tools_mcp(cache_mode="refresh")

```

### [​

](#sharing-a-cache-across-clients)Sharing a cache across clients

The default cache lives in each client’s process. To share cached responses across a fleet — a set of proxy replicas backed by one Redis, for example — pass a `KeyValueResponseCacheStore`, FastMCP’s adapter over the same `AsyncKeyValue` key-value abstraction the event store and OAuth proxy use. It accepts any compatible backend (memory, Redis, and more).
A shared store mingles responses from different principals, so it requires an explicit `partition` that isolates them. Derive the partition from a verified credential — never from request data or the server URL — and construct a new client when the principal changes. Only responses the server marks `"public"` are ever served across partitions.

```
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.caching import KeyValueResponseCacheStore
from mcp.client.caching import CacheConfig
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore

backend = RedisStore(url="redis://localhost")
store = KeyValueResponseCacheStore(storage=backend)

config = CacheConfig(store=store, partition="tenant-a", target_id="weather-api")
client = Client("https://example.com/mcp", mode="auto", cache=config)

```

The adapter serializes each result through a type-tagged envelope validated against an allowlist of cacheable result models, so a value naming an unknown type is treated as a cache miss rather than deserialized blindly. Each store instance owns its own collection namespace; `clear()` affects only that namespace, never another tenant’s entries.

## [​

](#client-extensions)Client extensions

Client extensions (SEP-2133) are the advanced mechanism a client uses to opt into vendor capabilities that live outside the core protocol. An extension is a `ClientExtension` instance that bundles three things: a capability *advertisement* the server can read, one or more *result claims* that let the client parse extra `tools/call` result shapes, and *notification bindings* that observe server notifications the core protocol doesn’t define. Pass a sequence of them to `extensions=`.

```
from fastmcp import Client
from myproject.extensions import AppsExtension

client = Client("https://example.com/mcp", extensions=[AppsExtension()])

```

Each extension’s contributions are threaded into the underlying session. FastMCP folds in its own internal extension for [background tasks](/clients/tasks) automatically, and your own extensions *compose* with it rather than replacing it — pass your own tasks extension with the same identifier if you need to override it. When a tool returns a shape an extension claims, `client.call_tool()` resolves it transparently through the owning claim’s resolver and hands you back an ordinary result. Result claims and their advertisements are honored only on modern-era connections, so they are inert on a legacy handshake.
For the rare case where you need to register additional result claims against an extension that is already advertised, pass them through `result_claims=`, keyed by the extension’s identifier. Prefer declaring claims on the extension itself; this parameter merges extra claims with an extension’s own.

```
client = Client(
    "https://example.com/mcp",
    extensions=[AppsExtension()],
    result_claims={"example.com/apps": [extra_claim]},
)

```

## [​

](#operations)Operations

FastMCP clients interact with three types of server components.
**Tools** are server-side functions that the client can execute with arguments. Call them with `call_tool()` and receive structured results.

```
async with client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    result = await client.call_tool("multiply", {"a": 5, "b": 3})
    print(result.data)  # 15

```

See [Tools](/clients/tools) for detailed documentation including version selection, error handling, and structured output.
**Resources** are data sources that the client can read, either static or templated. Access them with `read_resource()` using URIs.

```
async with client:
    resources = await client.list_resources()
    content = await client.read_resource("file:///config/settings.json")
    print(content[0].text)

```

See [Resources](/clients/resources) for detailed documentation including templates and binary content.
**Prompts** are reusable message templates that can accept arguments. Retrieve rendered prompts with `get_prompt()`.

```
async with client:
    prompts = await client.list_prompts()
    messages = await client.get_prompt("analyze_data", {"data": [1, 2, 3]})
    print(messages.messages)

```

See [Prompts](/clients/prompts) for detailed documentation including argument serialization.

## [​

](#callback-handlers)Callback Handlers

The client supports callback handlers for advanced server interactions. These let you respond to server-initiated requests and receive notifications.
Sampling, elicitation, and roots are the requests a server makes of the client. A server reaches your handler by whichever route its [era](#protocol-negotiation) allows — pushed down the open session on the handshake, returned as an input-required result on the modern protocol — and both routes dispatch to the same handler, so one registration covers both. Logging and progress arrive as notifications on the response stream and work in either era.

```
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.logging import LogMessage

async def log_handler(message: LogMessage):
    print(f"Server log: {message.data}")

async def progress_handler(progress: float, total: float | None, message: str | None):
    print(f"Progress: {progress}/{total} - {message}")

async def sampling_handler(messages, params, context):
    # Integrate with your LLM service here
    return "Generated response"

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    log_handler=log_handler,
    progress_handler=progress_handler,
    sampling_handler=sampling_handler,
    timeout=30.0
)

```

Each handler type has its own documentation:

- **[Sampling](/clients/sampling)** - Respond to server LLM requests

- **[Elicitation](/clients/elicitation)** - Handle server requests for user input

- **[Progress](/clients/progress)** - Monitor long-running operations

- **[Logging](/clients/logging)** - Handle server log messages

- **[Roots](/clients/roots)** - Provide local context to servers

The FastMCP Client is designed as a foundational tool. Use it directly for deterministic operations, or build higher-level agentic systems on top of its reliable, type-safe interface.[Architecture
